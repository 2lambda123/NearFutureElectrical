==================================
NEAR FUTURE ELECTRICAL PACK v0.6.1
==================================

This pack contains advanced electrical parts - capacitors, nuclear reactors and new battery packs.

============
INSTALLATION
============

I recommend removing any previous versions of Near Future Electrical before installing an update.

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so. 

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place these advanced solar panels in various high-tech nodes.
If you want to use this, also download TechManager (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98293-0-25-TechManager-Version-1-4) and ModuleManager (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-0-25-Module-Manager-2-5-1-%28Oct-08%29-Win64-must-die-edition)
