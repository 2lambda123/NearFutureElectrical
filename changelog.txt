- Fixed anti-DRE patch again
- Nuclear Reprocessor now works similarly to the ISRU in terms of heating mechanics
- Nuclear Reprocessor can now generate Xe from DepletedFuel at low efficiency
- ASRTG matches heat performance of stock RTG
- New models for 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 reactors (others coming eventually)

v0.5.3
------
- Fixed Fission Reactors saying that they were producing power (and actually producing heat) when empty, when they weren't
- New method to increase compatability with Deadly Re-entry's part temperature clamping
- Increased maximum reactor temperature for waste transfer to 600K, increased maximum temperature for repair to 550K
- Doubled base half life of RTGs in decaying RTG patch

v0.5.2
------
- Upgraded bundled CRP version
- Retuned radiator and reactor parts to work with stock radiator system
- Removed conformal radiators; they will later return in Heat Control 
- Tuned heat parameters for other parts

v0.5.1
------
- New anti-DRE patch to fix compatibility
- Fixed non-extant stock technode for heavy reactor parts
- Tweaks to radiator costs to match the ones in Heat Control
- Fixed Ore flow mode on uranium extractor
- Fixed negative cost on Whirlijig reprocessor
- Fixed attach node issue on 0.625m reactor

v0.5.0
------
- KSP 1.02 Update
- Bundled CRP
- All parts have had their attach nodes reworked with correct bulkhead sizes
- RTGs 
-- New RTG decay is available as an optional patch (applies to stock RTG and ASRTG)
-- RTGs decay to 0.05% of max power (can be overridden in cfg) over a certain half life
- Capacitors
-- Removed old automation panel
-- Replaced with ship capacitor summary window
-- Fixed dischargeability when storage empty
-- Discharge can now generate heat 
- Nuclear reprocessor
-- Uses stock resource converters (background processing)
-- Can now convert Ore into EnrichedUranium, at a very slow rate
- Reactors
-- Totally new system based on stock resource converters
-- Functionality similar, but no reactor window anymore
-- Uses stock heat system
- Nuclear fuel
-- New, better fuel transfer system
-- Click Transfer Fuel or Transfer waste to initiate a transfer
-- Click on a valid container to transfer to it (reprocessor, reactors, fuel containers)
-- Engineers are needed to transfer fuel, L1+. L3+ to transfer fuel
-- Transfer needs parts to be cool, on the same ship.
-- Nuclear waste generates a small amount of waste heat

v0.3.1
------
- Added support for the Community Tech Tree

v0.3.0
------
- Updated for KSP 0.25
- Updated part research entry costs
- Changed part cfg file names (no changes to actual part names)
- Some minor bugfixes to Capacitor and Reactor modules
- Converted all tga textures to mbm for improved memory use
- Added a ModuleManager patch to add Connected Living Spaces compatibility to all passable parts. ModuleManager is not included in the download

v0.2.2
------
- Rebalanced all Nuclear parts. Power outputs, masses, etc have all changed
- Added 3.75m MX-2 F.L.A.T. Fission Reactor
- Added B-800 Radial Battery Pack
- Added 3.75m B-10K Battery Bank
- Added PB-AS-NUK Radioisotope Generator
- Battery costs and masses now scale with total storage capacity
- 2.5m Stack Battery is now shorter by about 30%
- Capacitor cost per Sc reduced slightly, also scales with total storage capacity (as with mass)
- Recoded Reactor UI panel for better functionality
- Added a close button to the reactor UI panel
- Fixed a bug that could cause reactor highlights to get stuck on
- Fixed a bug that would cause reactors to be unable to refuel if there wasn't enough storage in a single waste container for their waste. Reactors now refuel from the first container and wait for the player to try again for the next container
- Fixed a bug that would cause waste containers to be unable to be used again if they were filled then emptied via reprocessing
- Initial pass at capacitor automation using the new Capacitor UI panel
-- Currently can disable or enable all capacitors and toggle automation on/off
-- Automation discharges capacitors in sequence from highest power rating to lowest power rating and attempts to maintain no power discharge
- Capacitors no longer turn off their recharge flag when they have recharged fully
- Improved emissive textures for reactor radiators

v0.2.1
------
- Fixed CAR-8K and CAR-EXTRA attach node size

v0.2.0
------
- SAVE BREAKING UDPATE! BE WARNED!
- Updated for KSP 0.24
- Added more logical costs for all parts
- Improved the functioning and look of the Reactor Control panel
- Increased the breaking force of all radiators when deployed
- Convective cooling of reactors and radiators now works properly, scales with pressure and vessel velocity

v0.1.0
------
- Split from main Near Future pack
- Rewrote radiator code for more efficiency, also breakability and rotation are now enabled and work properly
- Radiator sun tracking can be disabled in the VAB (this has no gameplay effect)
- Increased the density of EnrichedUranium and DepletedUranium by 10x. All capcacities and burn rates were also increased by 10x.
- Improved stability of MX-L reactor's power generation
- Reactor burn time now accounts for whether you use Kerbin time or Earth time scales in the game settings. Also improved the time display in general.
- Changed MX-L reactor dry mass from 18.25 to 22t
- Moved nuclear fuel drums to the Utility tab
